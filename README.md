## Version 1: Webpage Controls
Copy and paste the script in [add_to_webpage.js](https://github.com/do-me/vatican-windrose/blob/main/add_to_webpage.js) in your browser console. It adds the markers to your webpage as page controls. A click scrolls in the respective direction.

## Version 2: Leaflet Map Controls
Copy and paste the script in [add_to_leaflet.js](https://github.com/do-me/vatican-windrose/blob/main/add_to_leaflet.js) in your browser console. It adds the markers to your webpage as Leaflet Map controls. A click scrolls in the respective direction. Note that the `map` variable must be global. Test e.g. here: https://geo.rocks/hexbins/.
